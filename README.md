# Source
NetTop code follows the [Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) guidelines described by Robert C. Martin.

### Libraries used
- **[RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)**, the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) implementation for Java.
- **[Dagger 2](https://google.github.io/dagger/)** to perform dependency injection without using reflection.
- **[Retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda)** so that Java 8 *lambdas* and *method references* can be used on the code.
- **[ButterKnife](https://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/)** which provides field and method binding for views.
